Today I learned about CSS Grid's `auto-fit` and `minmax()` functions that can create responsive layouts without media queries.

## The Problem

I was trying to create a responsive card layout that would automatically adjust the number of columns based on the available space.

## The Solution

Using CSS Grid with `auto-fit` and `minmax()`:

```css
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(300px, 1fr));
  gap: 1rem;
}
```

## How it works

- `repeat()` creates repeating grid tracks
- `auto-fit` automatically fits as many columns as possible
- `minmax(300px, 1fr)` sets minimum width of 300px and maximum of 1fr (equal distribution)

This creates a layout that automatically adjusts from 1 column on mobile to multiple columns on larger screens, all without media queries!

## Browser Support

CSS Grid has excellent browser support (95%+ globally), making this a reliable solution for modern web development.
