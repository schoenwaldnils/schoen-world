With flexbox there is now a simple way to let your footer stick to the bottom, when there is not enough content, and make it static when there is.

## HTML Structure

At first we need the HTML-skeleton. One wrapper, in this case the body-element itself, and at least 2 child-elements. I'm also including the header here, because it is often used in this kind of arrangement.

```html
<body>
  <div class="Header"></div>
  <div class="Content"></div>
  <div class="Footer"></div>
</body>
```

## Container Setup

And now give the `body` `display: flex` and `flex-direction: column` to stack the three child elements vertically.  
To support IE 11 we also need those styles on the `html` element.  
Also the `body` elements need to be at least `100vh` in height.

```css
html,
body {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
}
body {
  min-height: 100vh;
}
```

## The Magic Touch

The trick now is to give the `.Content`-element the `flex-grow: 1` so the footer gets pushed to the bottom.  
You can also add `flex-shrink: 0` to the other elements so that they don't get squished when the viewport is too small.

```css
.Header,
.Footer {
  flex-shrink: 0;
}
.Content {
  flex-grow: 1;
}
```

And voil√° your footer is at the bottom all the time.

## The Complete Result

The complete CSS solution:

```css
html,
body {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
}
body {
  min-height: 100vh;
}
.Header,
.Footer {
  flex-shrink: 0;
}
.Content {
  flex-grow: 1;
}
```
