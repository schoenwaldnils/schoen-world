We build robots to clean our floors and clothes and dishes. Our autos are intelligent enough to know when they’re too close to the car ahead, responding by smoothly applying the brakes.\n\nIf we can dream it, we can create it — eventually. And one of the most profound uses cases of blockchain tech is bitcoin, the world’s first cryptocurrency.\n\nBitcoin’s underlying technology — blockchain — is a creation borne of self-sovereignty. However, the notorious Nakamoto (assumptively) didn’t foresee the positive additions blockchain tech could offer the entertainment industry — Satoshi had his sights locked on centralized finance.\n\nWe no longer have to deal with the swindling bottom dwellers inhabiting any sector. Available today are permanent, distributed, publicly-verifiable records of various datasets. Blockchain shakes fraudsters right out of business because there’s nowhere for them to hide.\n\nNow, you can name almost any industry and chances are high that blockchain can make it better. Voting, health care, ID verification (KYC), loans, land ownership, the list goes on. And one of the industries that’s more than ready for a blockchain upgrade is video games. Especially in the high-stakes realm of competitive esports.\n\nYou see, we’re not talking about Sudoku here. Casual games certainly have their time and place, but nobody’s coming out to watch people play them! Conversely, specific gaming tournaments draw enormous crowds.\n\nFor example, in South Korea, it’s not uncommon for pro StarCraft and League of Legends players to receive an ecstatic welcome from thousands of rabid, screaming fans. Celebrity gamers are whisked to tournaments in speedboats and helicopters, emerging to greet sold-out coliseums.",
